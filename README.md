# Wordclock Stencil Mono

Font designed specifically for wordclock projects. It has a stencil design for decal applications. And is easy to CNC with round edges.

Note: Only caps in French language and four arrows `↗↘↙↖` (for minutes) have been designed so far.

## Build it

The font was originaly built using [this Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1115382696459820988) and [this Figma script](https://gist.github.com/rsms/a8ad736ba3d448100577de2b88e826de) by Rasmus.


## Origin

Wordclock Stencil Mono draws inspirations from [Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono) and some techniques used by [Qlocktwo](https://qlocktwo.com/) on some pieces with stencil design.

I made a first wordclock for my brother using Space Mono. Two things could be improved. One, when doing decal, a stencil design produces better, more repeatable results. Second, the font has a lot of sharp edges and has extra terminal on caps wich produces a clutered clock face. This is how Wordclock Stencil Mono was born.
